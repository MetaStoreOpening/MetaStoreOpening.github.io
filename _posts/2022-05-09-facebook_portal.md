This newer version of Facebook Portal is very easily detachable from the base. It has a three prong magnetic connection and it can also be rotated around its base. It has some built-in AI which is able to focus the camera area to the speaker and follow movement. That mechanism doesn't have any moving parts, it's software based, driven by AI. It's also notable that on all Portal devices I saw factory built-in camera covers and there's also hardware microphone switch-off too. Privacy is a primary citizen.
