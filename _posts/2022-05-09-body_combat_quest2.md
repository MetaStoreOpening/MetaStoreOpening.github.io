The player is deep into the Les Mills Body Combat Quest boxing VR game. The white and left objects need to be strictly punched by the left and the right hand otherwise they don't count. The shape and orientation of the targets determine if you have to jab, upper cut or hook. The bars need to be avoided by leaning.
