Just like with the old Oculus headsets you could see on the computer screen what the VR players see, the arena allowed us to experience what the players sees projected to a giant wall. The arena was equipped with a device in the corner which kept an eye ont he player, and there were projectors on the top as well. There was a ring light showing where the player supposed to stand. Very cool setup!
