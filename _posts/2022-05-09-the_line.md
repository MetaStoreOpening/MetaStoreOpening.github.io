After arriving I searched for a long time for a Level 2 car charger. ChargePoint indicated many chargers, but even the ones looked to be accessible proved to be in underground garages. It turns out that there are no chargers for visitors, and this is the time when I'm happy that I have a PHEV and I can still get home even if I cannot charge (I ended up charging BTW, see the last post). You can see here the line right after I found the building and the line at the entrance.
